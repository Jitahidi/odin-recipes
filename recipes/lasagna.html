        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle 
            or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna 
            sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the 
            lasagna noodles.</p>
        <p>Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which food was being cooked 
            rather than the pasta itself.  Lasagna recipes have been around for ages, dating back 
            to as early as the thirteenth century.  Today, lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties 
            from veggies and cream sauces to traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as meat 
            lasagnas.</p> 
        <p>Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna has been attributed to the city of Naples.</p>

            <li>1 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>.08 egg</li>
            <li>.06 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium 
                heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, 
                and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon 
                salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
                stirring occasionally.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
                boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 
                teaspoon salt.</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking 
                dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the 
                ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 
                cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat 
                layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to 
                prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does 
                not touch the cheese.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. 
                Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
