        <h1>Description</h1>
        
            <p>Country-style ribs aren't ribs at all, but blade steaks or chops. 
                Cut from the blade portion of the loin's shoulder end, they often 
                include part of the upper rib bones, though they may be boneless. 
                They have a lot of connective tissue and fat, making them ideal for 
                barbecue, not unlike real ribs.</p>
        
            <h2>Ingredients (4 Servings) </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 ½ pounds pork spareribs </li>
                    <li>2 (18 ounce) bottles barbeque sauce </li>
                    <li>1 onion, quartered </li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place spareribs in a large stock pot with barbeque sauce, onion, 
                    salt, and pepper. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a low boil, 
                    and cook approximately 40 minutes.</li>

                <li>Preheat grill for high heat.</li>

                <li>Lightly oil grate. Remove spareribs from the stock pot, and place on 
                    the prepared grill. Use the barbeque sauce in the saucepan to baste 
                    ribs while cooking. Grill ribs, basting and turning frequently, for 
                    20 minutes, or until nicely browned.</li>
